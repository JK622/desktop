# TrebleShot for Desktop
This project is in development. See what we are up to [here](https://github.com/genonbeta/TrebleShot-Desktop/projects/1)


# What else
You can still use [Android version](https://github.com/genonbeta/TrebleShot). You can also support us, which will also boost this project as well.

# How can I contribute or help this happen now
We will need testers for Linux (all flavors), MacOS for compiling and testing and Windows for testing (probably compiling too).

# Other than that
You should definitely join Google+ community and Hangouts group. You can find link to them in the Android project.
